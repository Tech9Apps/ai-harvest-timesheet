   - Use a centralized loading context for managing multiple loading states
   - Show appropriate loading indicators for each operation
   - Disable relevant UI elements during loading
   - Provide visual feedback for long-running operations
   - Handle errors gracefully during loading states

8. Data Persistence:
   - Use namespaced keys for localStorage
   - Implement proper error handling for storage operations
   - Create dedicated service for data persistence
   - Keep storage logic separate from UI components

9. Date Handling:
   - Use date-fns for consistent date manipulation
   - Always consider timezone implications
   - Use startOfDay and endOfDay for accurate date ranges
   - Implement proper date validation and constraints
   - Provide intuitive date selection UI
   - Keep default behavior (today) easily accessible
   - Handle date range changes efficiently

10. Component Organization:
    - Create reusable components for common patterns
    - Keep state management close to where it's needed
    - Use proper prop types for component interfaces
    - Implement clear component boundaries
    - Handle loading and error states consistently
    - Provide meaningful default values

# Questions to Ask
1. Should we implement user preferences for work hours (currently fixed at 8 hours)?
2. How should we handle commits that span multiple days?
3. Should we implement a preview feature before syncing time entries?
4. What should be the minimum Git commit information required for a valid time entry?
5. Should we add more date range presets (e.g., This Week, Last Week)?
6. How should we handle timezone differences between Git commits and Harvest entries?
