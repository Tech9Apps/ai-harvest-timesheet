# Current Task
Create an Electron-Vite with React application for automating time logging in Harvest based on Git commit history.

## Project Analysis
The project requires building a desktop application that will:
1. Allow users to manage local Git repositories
2. Integrate with Harvest API for time tracking
3. Process Git commit history
4. Create time entries in Harvest based on commits
5. Provide a user-friendly interface with Material UI and dark theme

## Technical Stack
- Electron-Vite with React for the desktop application
- TypeScript for type safety
- Simple-git for Git operations
- Axios for API calls
- LowDB for local data storage
- dotenv for environment variables
- Material UI for components
- Node-keytar for secure token storage

## Next Steps
1. Set up testing environment
2. Implement error boundary
3. Add input validation
4. Add more comprehensive error handling

# Lessons Learned
1. Environment Variables:
   - Use `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env` in Vite applications
   - Prefix environment variables with `VITE_` for client-side access
   - Create type definitions for environment variables in `env.d.ts`

2. TypeScript Configuration:
   - Install necessary type definitions (@types/react, @types/node)
   - Create proper interfaces for all data structures
   - Use type assertions carefully with external APIs

3. React Best Practices:
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use proper state management for complex data
   - Implement loading states for async operations
   - Use context for shared state like loading indicators

4. Electron-Vite:
   - Follow proper security practices for IPC communication
   - Handle file system operations carefully
   - Implement proper error handling for native operations

5. Git Integration:
   - Validate repositories before operations
   - Handle different branch name formats
   - Process commit history efficiently

6. UI/UX:
   - Implement proper form validation
   - Show loading states during async operations
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Use consistent styling with Material UI theme
   - Use progress indicators for better user feedback
   - Disable interactive elements during loading

7. Loading States:
   - Use a centralized loading context for managing multiple loading states
   - Show appropriate loading indicators for each operation
   - Disable relevant UI elements during loading
   - Provide visual feedback for long-running operations
   - Handle errors gracefully during loading states

# Questions to Ask
1. Should we implement user preferences for work hours (currently fixed at 8 hours)?
2. How should we handle commits that span multiple days?
3. Should we implement a preview feature before syncing time entries?
4. What should be the minimum Git commit information required for a valid time entry?
